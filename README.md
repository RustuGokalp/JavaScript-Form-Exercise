# JavaScript-Form-Exercise
- Using **JavaScript and the BootStrap toolkit**, I made a form that lists the entered data.
- I designed a form that lists the information of the inputs and then resets the contents of the inputs again.
- If these inputs are tried to be sent empty, a warning will be sent to the user.
- You can see the work I have done through the screenshots I will leave below. Thank you for your interest.
